  <h2>Contesting the Image as Truth</h2>
  <br>
  <p>There is a historical precedent of photography’s ability to properly express the truth, and with it, a  long-standing tradition of questioning whether that truth is to be believed. In her famed series of essays, On Photography, Susan Sontag addresses this concept, writing “photographs furnish evidence. Something we hear about, but doubt, seems proven when we’re shown a photograph of it” (Sontag 1977, 3). Yet the question of whether a photograph, or any visual image, can be regarded as truthful remains highly contested. In the era of fake news, mass media viewership trust fall to “historic lows” following the 2016 election (Lazer et al. 2018). However mass media remains the space where most of the public receives information via text and images, often filtered through and viewed on social media platforms such as Facebook (Lazer et al. 2018). 
  </p>

  <p>Misinformation and “fake news” is disseminated more easily than ever due to the speed of circulation, increasingly emotionalized online discourse, and a rise in users who profit from social media platforms (Bakir and McStay 2018). In addition, false information is shared more rapidly, and by more people, than true information on social media (Lazer et al. 2018). This sharing of information, regardless of it being true or false, creates echo chambers in which an individual’s tolerance for views that differ from their own is lowered and the likelihood of seeing alternative views diminishes (Lazer et al. 2018; Bakir and McStay 2018). This is especially dangerous in regard to climate change, as individuals are most influenced in their perception of climate change based on the beliefs and expressions of their peers (Kahan et al. 2012).  
  </p>

  <p>It is increasingly difficult to recommend, advise, or even summate what climate imagery should look like today. For image-makers, this conundrum poses a variety of potential problems. There is evidence to support stalled impact images, such as those of floods and major deforestation, as being motivational for viewers and most likely to be shared within social circles. However, the same imagery has been shown to overwhelm viewers, and ultimately reduces engagement (Chapman et al. 2016). Climate change has become a highly politicized issue, creating a perceived divide between those who believe and those who do not. As these views are shaped by peers and social networks, it is possible that curating imagery to target groups on social media platforms addressing individual and group concerns could yield positive results. However, a much broader longitudinal study would be needed to test the effectiveness  of this approach. 
  </p>

  <h2>Themes and Concepts</h2>
  <p>Science Communication</p>
  <br>
  <p>Present-day representation of climate science in media relies heavily upon the unsubstantiated belief that the general public is lacking in basic science literacy skills (Kahan et al. 2012). Science communication in this context is the presentation of scientific information through visual resources such as photography or illustration with the intent of making facts and figures from experts more digestible to a general audience. However, science literacy has been shown to have little impact, or in some cases a negative impact (see Kahan et al. 2012), on climate change beliefs. In a study examining science literacy on perceived climate change risks, researchers tested to see whether climate change concern is “positively correlated with numeracy” but these predictions were unsupported. This reveals that as science literacy increases, an individual’s  concern with climate change decreases (Kahan et al. 2012). Similarly, “scepticism about climate change is unlikely to be overcome by presenting ‘more science’, as sceptics who score the highest on science literacy tests are likely to be the most confident in their beliefs” (Corner 2012, 710). As such, if there is to be an improved approach to visual representation of climate change, it should not rely on direct representation of science as a method of engaging viewers, as it is neither visually stimulating nor the solution to skepticism and denial. 
  </p>
  <p>Climate change advocates often rely on anecdotal evidence to decide which images they use in communicating environmental issues; moreover, practitioners’ intuitions about “effective” visual communication messages sometimes conflict with what researchers have found, such as the continued use of ‘stalled’ imagery of climate change which reads as cliché to viewers (Chapman et al. 2016). As a result of this lack of modification of visual practices, what we see in widespread circulation is an abundance of stalled, unemotive, repetitive visuals. These visuals do not aid in activating the public or properly relay the information of experts
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Redundant Visuals</p>
  <br>
  <p>Bright red heat index maps, melted glaciers, stranded polar bears, dried river beds, and raging forest fires—these images are repeated over and over again, thematically and visually, when “climate change” is searched in Google images. These types of images are those that are linked in news reports and think pieces about the climate crisis, sometimes the same single image linked to multiple sources. At other times, images are collaged together, a conglomeration of all the terrifying effects we can expect to see on earth in one tidy package. This redundancy of visuals plays a problematic role in the visual communication of climate change. 
  </p>
  <p>Though the acknowledgment and public perception of the climate crisis appears to be changing, global imagery in relation to climate change has not. The current representation of environmental issues relies on tired and overused symbolism of climate change causes and impacts. This repetition causes factually important subject matter and once-poignant images to lose their initial potency and ability to sustain viewer attention. Studies have shown that, despite being easily recognizable, participants found typical climate imagery—melting ice, polar bears—to be “clichéd” (Chapman et al. 2016, 174). Additionally, when individuals were questioned regarding their feelings after viewing stalled imagery, the response was that of cynicism and fatigue (Corner, Webster, and Teriete 2015). The overuse of environmental imagery has created a desensitization, making the images void of their initial meaning and no longer capable of activating an audience.    
  </p>
  <p>When studying a small data sample of the top 100 Google images associated with the search “climate change” (October 7, 2019), only one of the first 100 images was found to be focused on humans as the primary subject, compared to fourteen featuring polar bears or crumbling ice caps. Methodologically, our qualitative small data analysis places onus on the viewing order and hierarchical implications of a google image search. In our data set we found that each image found in the top 100 images is linked from a major news outlet, government organization, or public website; none are directly user-generated images from private websites or shared by an individual. It would seem logical that as our lives become increasingly pictorial, the minutiae of each day shared visually on Instagram and Snapchat, new, personal representations of climate change would emerge within these image-centric platforms. Yet in looking at social media, many of the posts on Instagram were also not individually user generated. Instead, through the process of reposting and re-sharing, the same ‘stalled’ imagery has been adopted and continues to dominate. Very few images are being made by individuals in response to climate change, and there remains a distinct lack of posts which share authentic personal concerns. Further data is currently being collected regarding climate change representations on Instagram to further substantiate the trends we have noted.
  </p>
  <p>In the process of revising this article, both authors have witnessed a change in visual responses due to the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires. This research began collaboratively while both parties were in New South Wales but has shifted as one author has returned to the United States. We have noted not only a distinct difference in the imagery tied to the bushfires based on locality, but also an increase in individual, user-generated imagery. However, despite “1 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia” having burned since the start of the season, and coverage of the destruction having reached news outlets worldwide, the majority of images tied to these stories remain “stalled”  and our findings have not changed significantly (BBC 2020). Five of the first 100 images from a revised Google search (February 10, 2020) now engage humans within the frame, with all of them relating to fires or elevated global temperatures. This leads us to believe that the only way the imagery connected to climate change will change is through human engagement with natural disasters—a terrifying way to resolve this problem. Repeating the search one month later (March 10, 2020), humans appear in nine of the first 100 images. This slow increase points toward a potential change in visual representations of climate change in the future, as individuals’ direct environments become increasingly impacted upon. 
  </p>
  <p>The question remains—if overused stalled imagery and reliance on visual representation of scientific fact is not the ideal method for communicating climate change, why are such images still prevalent in the media? Höijer (2010, 718) argues that climate change exists “beyond our perceptual capacity of experience and is based on expert knowledge.” It is difficult to succinctly encapsulate the wide range of issues that fall under the umbrella of “climate change” in a way that is understandable to a general audience and while not relying on outside resources. Much of what is occurring ecologically is outside of personal experience and exists only in theory to a general public; they are not witness to it in their everyday lives.2 These overused, stalled images  are easily understood by the western world and have become symbols for climate change rather than actual representations of climate change impacts. This contributes to climate change remaining a hypothetical concept rather than a tangible issue to be dealt with.  
  </p>
  <p>There is also a lack of sufficient, easily accessible, alternative visual representations of climate change, and therefore the same types of images are reproduced over and over again in their absence. The images that are used are often shocking, which is ideal in a public demonstration or media setting, as they quickly capture the attention of a viewer. While fear and sensational imagery may induce feelings of concern, O’Neill argues this type of imagery also has an “overwhelmingly…’negative’ impact on active engagement with climate change”  amongst viewer participants (O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole 2009, 376). We also summate that stalled images may remain prevalent, despite the increase in awareness of and concern for the climate crisis, because of the subtlety of the visuals of everyday climate change effects compared to the drama of catastrophic environmental imagery.    
  </p>
  <p>More than ever, viewers are flooded with and rely upon media to provide them with information, but there is an increasing uncertainty as to the validity of communications. In a recent study, Lehman et al. (2019) found news media still overwhelmingly favors presenting images of politicians in conjunction with climate change stories, despite this being at odds with what audiences express as salient to them or what has been suggested by scholars as best practice.
  </p>
  <p>The recent findings of Lehman et al. (2019) are primarily psychological, investigating the emotional response to images from the Climate Visuals online catalogue. Yet images that are the most exciting to viewers are not the best representation of the climate crisis. It is understandable that images of polar bears registered as the most relevant to climate change— these animals have been used as the primary representative of environmentalism for nearly forty years (Lehman et al. 2019). However, it is clear that these heavily reproduced stalled images, such as those of the polar bear and ice floes, are no longer effective in stimulating an audience or inciting action. It is not that these images are most effective; it is more likely that they are simply the most well-known.
  </p>
     
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>A contemporary example of miscommunication due to stalled imagery combined with social media decontextualization is that of the plastic straw. Anti-straw campaigns first appeared in 2017, with their momentum being fueled by a viral video of scientists removing a plastic straw from the nose of a sea turtle in Costa Rica in 2018. That same year, Greenpeace Canada released a series of ads featuring sea animals with straws protruding from their mouths and the tagline “don’t suck the life from our oceans” (Greenpeace, 2018). 
  </p>
  <p>This and similar campaigns may be attractive and engaging, but they direct attention to continued consumer practices rather than political action. Plastic straws are only a drop in the ocean in regard to both pollution and the grander scale of the climate crisis, making up “less than 1 percent” of ocean pollution (Jordan 2018). This imagery momentarily captures the attention of the public, but it is unclear whether shocking environmental imagery is strong enough to cut through and remain pertinent. In looking at an earlier single-use plastic bag ban campaign, 40 percent of participants failed to remember any of the advertising executions after only two months of the campaign ending (Sharp, Høj, and Wheeler 2010). It was also recorded that out of those participants who could recall at least one advertisement, nine out of ten were already bringing reusable bags shopping with them. Similar to the echo chambers mentioned above, this feedback loop also occurs with positive behavior. This adds additional complexity in developing a new approach to visual communications and climate change, as images need to reach beyond individuals who are already motivated (“preaching to the choir”).
  </p>
  <p>Shocking images of climate change impacts, salient but outrageous, point directly to an issue and give an easily adaptable answer: stop using straws. However, despite public outcry,  there is still a lack of larger policy integration and ultimately effective change (Villarrubia Gómez, Cornell, and Fabres 2018). Solution-based imagery and media campaigns can make climate change approachable or feel “solvable” to the general public, but Corner also writes that these images can reduce people’s concern as they lack a personal and relatable sense of risk (Corner, Webster, and Teriete 2015). When the primary focus of most imagery presented is that of the earth aside from humans, such as those of animals and natural phenomena, it “appeals to the need to protect what Westerners understand as nature - something distinct from them” (Slocum 2004, 428). This furthers the removal of climate change as an issue that already impacts humans and will only become worse with time. Plastic straw campaigns saw significant consumer reaction and traction online, but the reality is that this particular concern is only a  small percentage of damage within the much grander scale of climate change causes.  
  </p>

  <h2>Lack of Activation</h2>
  <p>Contemporary environmental campaigns such as those listed above discourage or remove opportunity for critical thinking by making imagery overly direct and easily absorbed. One argument is that these types of images may lead a consumer to adjust their choices and further investigate environmental issues moving forward. However, the negative repercussion of this imagery is the oversimplification of issues that should very much remain complex. One difficulty is that “the direct and indirect effects of climate change, as well as the phenomenon itself, are often unseen” (Manzo 2010, 202). To try and make something visual from the intangible is an incredibly difficult task.
  </p>
  <p>The process of making climate change easily digestible and simplified gives the appearance of an easy solution existing, creating further confusion about the causes and effects of climate change. Nicholson-Cole (2005, 267) found that most viewers “stressed that they would become more motivated if they could understand what it would mean for them, what they could do, and be regularly reminded of that by the media, government efforts and other everyday sources of information.” In the past, advertising agencies have been heavily critiqued for “greenwashing”  products and consumer practices. Greenwashing occurs when consumers are strategically made to feel at fault for environmental degradation, or are offered a new, shiny solution in purchasing something promoted as “eco-friendly.” Though not a new concept, companies are increasingly utilizing greenwashing techniques in response to social concerns surrounding climate change. The adoption of “green” visuals in this consumer setting only serves to complicate visual communication of climate change further. While a large number of consumers have cottoned on to this type of marketing, making this ineffectual, the need to alleviate personal guilt in regard to climate change is still present in consumer practice. With the proliferation of such guilt driven media, it is understandable that campaigns such as #stopsucking and other plastic straw movements gained traction. These calls for change were one of the first examples of individual action given as a solution to current climate related issues, and at relatively little cost to individual consumers.
  </p>
  <p>However, in making the climate crisis consumer-focused and action-oriented, there is a  barrier between individuals and the comprehension of the larger and complex nature of climate change. Through social media, makers and viewers are able to present a simple, albeit diluted, solution to a problem, and this message spreads instantaneously. Though there is activation and communication, and arguably a good deed is committed, it is simply not enough to make  significant changes in such a far-reaching crisis. This type of image-making and image consumption falls into the space of slacktivism, or “political activities that have no impact on real-life political outcomes, but only serve to increase the feel-good factor of the participants”  (Christensen 2011, para. 1). Consumers seek an easy way to feel that they have in some way contributed to a cause and made a difference, without giving any further thought to the matter (Hansen et al. 2012). The same could be said for visual work and the practitioners who create it—they are well intentioned in looking to help, but it is problematic to create work highlighting only one piece of climate change as representative of the whole.

  <h1>What Is a “Document”?</h1>
  <p><strong>By Michael K. Buckland</strong></p>
  <p>Original paper located <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-4571%28199709%2948%3A9%3C804%3A%3AAID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO%3B2-V">here</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Ordinarily the word “document” denotes a textual record. Increasingly sophisticated attempts to provide access to the rapidly growing quantity of available documents raised questions about what should be considered a “document.” The answer is important for any definition of the scope of Information Science. Paul Otlet and others developed a functional view of “document” and discussed whether, for example, sculpture, museum objects, and live animals, could be considered “documents.” Suzanne Briet equated “document” with organized physical evidence. These ideas appear to resemble notions of “material culture” in cultural anthropology and “object-as-sign” in semiotics. Others, especially in the U.S.A. (e.g., Jesse Shera and Louis Shores) took a narrower view. New digital technology renews old questions and also old confusions between medium, message, and meaning.</em></p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>What is a document? What could not be a document? Ordinarily information storage and retrieval systems have been concerned with text and text-like records (e.g., names, numbers, and alphanumeric codes). The present interest in “multimedia” reminds us that not all phenomena of interest in information science are textual or textlike. We may need to deal with any phenomena that someone may wish to observe: Events, processes, images, and objects as well as texts.</p>

  <p>This article reconstructs and comments on the development of thought on this topic with an emphasis on the ideas of continental European documentalists in the first half of this century. If “documentation” (a term that included information storage and retrieval systems) is what you do to or with documents, how far could you push the meaning of “document” and what were the limits to “documentation”? The work of European pioneers such as Paul Otlet and Suzanne Briet has received renewed attention in recent years and has been related to discussion of physical forms of “information”.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> These issues are important because mechanical information systems can only operate on physical representations of “information.” This background is relevant to the clarification of the nature and scope of information systems.</p>

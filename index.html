  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In 2018, a landmark report created by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was released highlighting the irrefutable statistics of our global decline and the immediate necessity for humans to act now. (IPCC 2018) The Global Outlook Report, released a year later, delivers the same time-sensitive message, stating “climate change is fast outpacing us and needs an urgent response by all segments of society.” (UNDP 2019, 4) Worldwide, we have seen the momentum toward climate change build, with international protests uniting or dividing the population. (Peñafiel and Doran 2018; Pickard and Bessant 2018)

  <br>
  <p>In today’s visual culture, access to smartphones, social media, and proliferating news articles means that controversial and popular world issues are increasingly hard to ignore. Alongside this, the way that we engage with the news media has changed. (Bakir and McStay 2018) There is increased popularity in image-driven platforms such as Instagram, and Google image searches have become a way to quickly understand, digest, and familiarize yourself with an issue. When undertaking a Google image search, the corresponding images associated with the key word do not necessarily represent what the core issue is, but more profoundly, what it looks like, or more specifically, what others tell you it looks like. The textual context that the image initially resides within, or alongside, can often be regarded as less important in the hierarchy of information, as the visual content is what drives engagement. (Mawhinney 2018)

  <h2>Redundant Visuals</h2>
  <p>Bright red heat index maps, melted glaciers, stranded polar bears, dried river beds—these images are repeated over and over again, thematically and visually, when “climate change” is searched in Google images. These types of images are those that are linked in news reports and think pieces about the climate crisis, sometimes the same single image linked to multiple sources. At other times, images are collaged together, a conglomeration of all the terrifying effects we can expect to see on earth in one tidy package. This redundancy of visuals plays a problematic role in the visual communication of climate change.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Though the acknowledgment and public perception of the climate crisis appears to be changing, global imagery in relation to climate change has not. The current representation of environmental issues relies on tired and overused symbolism of climate change causes and impacts. This repetition causes factually important subject matter and once-poignant images to lose their initial potency and ability to sustain viewer attention. Studies have shown that, despite being easily recognizable, participants found typical climate imagery—melting ice, polar bears—to be “clichéd.” (Chapman et al. 2016, 174) Additionally, when individuals were questioned regarding their feelings after viewing stalled imagery, the response was that of cynicism and fatigue. (Corner, Webster, and Teriete 2015) The overuse of environmental imagery has created a desensitization, making the images void of their initial meaning and no longer capable of activating an audience. When studying a small data sample of the top 100 Google images associated with the search “climate change,” (October 7, 2019) only one of the first 100 images was found to be focused on humans as the primary subject, compared to fourteen featuring polar bears or crumbling ice caps.

  <p>In the process of revising this article, both authors have witnessed a change in visual responses due to the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires. This research began collaboratively while both parties were in New South Wales but has shifted as one author has returned to the United States. We have noted not only a distinct difference in the imagery tied to the bushfires based on locality, but also an increase in individual, user-generated imagery. However, despite “1 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia” having burned since the start of the season, and coverage of the destruction having reached news outlets worldwide, the majority of images tied to these stories remain “stalled” and our findings have not changed significantly. (BBC 2020) Five of the first 100 images from a revised Google search (February 10, 2020) now engage humans within the frame, with all of them relating to fires or elevated global temperatures. This leads us to believe that the only way the imagery connected to climate change will change is through human engagement with natural disasters—a terrifying way to resolve this problem. Repeating the search one month later (March 10, 2020) humans appear in nine of the first 100 images. This slow increase points toward a potential change in visual representations of climate change in the future, as individuals’ direct environments become increasingly impacted upon.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The question remains—if overused stalled imagery and reliance on visual representation of scientific fact is not the ideal method for communicating climate change, why are such images still prevalent in the media? (Höijer 2010, 718) argues that climate change exists “beyond our perceptual capacity of experience and is based on expert knowledge.” It is difficult to succinctly encapsulate the wide range of issues that fall under the umbrella of “climate change” in a way that is understandable to a general audience and while not relying on outside resources. Much of what is occurring ecologically is outside of personal experience and exists only in theory to a general public; they are not witness to it in their everyday lives. These overused, stalled images are easily understood by the western world and have become symbols for climate change rather than actual representations of climate change impacts. This contributes to climate change remaining a hypothetical concept rather than a tangible issue to be dealt with. There is also a lack of sufficient, easily accessible, alternative visual representations of climate change, and therefore the same types of images are reproduced over and over again in their absence. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>It is understandable that images of polar bears registered as the most relevant to climate change— these animals have been used as the primary representative of environmentalism for nearly forty years. (Lehman et al. 2019) However, it is clear that these heavily reproduced stalled images, such as those of the polar bear and ice floes, are no longer effective in stimulating an audience or inciting action. It is not that these images are most effective; it is more likely that they are simply the most well-known.
